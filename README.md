# Localization Homework
This simple projects serves as a starting point for you homework assignment. **Please start by forking this repository into your own GitHub account.**

Your goal is to setup a fully-automated localization workflow in Memsource that will localize this README.md file (i.e. a new localization project is automatically created by Automated Project Creation feature when content of the file changes in your GitHub repository). After the translation is completed in Memsource, the translations are exported to the same GitHub repository, each language to a separate file.

Set up the workflow to localize to at least two languages of your choice. The file should be pre-translated using a machine translation engine.

When presenting your final localization workflow setup, you should demonstrate:
* your full setup in Memsource
* that modification to this file will trigger the automated workflow
* how your automated setup actually works, by guiding us through the process of localizing the changes made in the previous step
* how finishing the localization of the file results in exporting the translations to the GitHub repository
* what were your pain points and which areas of the process would you try to improve
